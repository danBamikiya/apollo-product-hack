# Hackathon walkthrough

In this hackathon, we're going to take the example of an existing e-commercce application that we will create a GraphQL proof of concept for. There are two folders for this project that contain walkthroughs for both JavaScript and TypeScript. Please file an issue for any problems you encounter!
